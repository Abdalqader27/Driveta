# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - images/car_android.png
     - images/car_ios.png
     - images/desticon.png
     - images/desticon1.png
     - images/logo.png
     - images/logo1.png
     - images/pickicon.png
     - images/posimarker.png
     - images/redmarker.png
     - images/taxi.png
     - images/user_icon.png
     - images/uberx.png
     - sounds/alert.mp3
     - assets/
     - assets/images/intro/
     - assets/images/
     - res/translation/
     - assets/icons/
     - assets/flr/
     - assets/lottie/
     - README.md

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Signatra
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signatra.ttf
    - family: Brand-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/bolt-regular.ttf
    - family: Brand Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/bolt-semibold.ttf
    - family: sst-arabic
      fonts:
        - asset:  assets/fonts/sst_arabic_bold.ttf
        - asset:  assets/fonts/sst_arabic_light.ttf
        - asset:  assets/fonts/sst_arabic_medium.ttf
        - asset:  assets/fonts/sst_arabic_roman.ttf
